It is a multiplayer game created with PyGame library for Python lectures at University of Gdańsk.


## Features

## Description

The goal of the game will be to create the perfect vault. Before the vault is opened to other players, its creator will first have to prove that it can be traversed by going through it themselves. Both the time taken to traverse it and the treasury itself will be made available on the server for other players to go through.

The game will combine elements of puzzles and skill-based games so that players derive maximum satisfaction from conquering the treasury or successfully defending it.
